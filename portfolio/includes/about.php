                    <p>
                        Hello, I am a web design/developer based in Portland, Oregon. I build websites using WordPress, PHP, JavaScript, and HTML.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently seeking a web design position with a creative department or agency. If interested, you may contact me using
                        the <a href="#contact">form</a> below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also offer web design, social media marketing, and SEO services focusing on small businesses. I work with clients locally
                        and nationally.
                    </p>
                   
                        <p>
                            In my free time, I like to travel, hike, binge on Netflix shows, and hang out with my Boston Terrier, Reggie.
                        </p>
