    <p>
        The following are WordPress websites I have created for clients.
    </p>
    
        <div class="row">
            <div class="gallery_product col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 filter hdpe">
                <a href="http://aliawong.com"><img src="assets/images/AliaWong.jpg" class="img-responsive"
                                                   alt="profile picture"></a>
                <h3><a href="http://aliawong.com">Alia Wong</a></h3>
                <h4>Journalism</h4>
                <p>Alia Wong is an award winning journalist for the publication, The Atlantic. She was looking to update her existing website with a more modern feel. We refreshed her site by taking a minimalistic approach, focusing on the content and using light uncluttered pages. She has a blog that features her latest published works.</p>

            <div class="gallery_product col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 filter hdpe">
                <a href="https://rarespirals.com"><img src="assets/images/tourmalinesingle.jpg" class="img-responsive"
                                                       alt="jewelry"></a>
                <h3><a href="https://rarespirals.com">Rare Spirals</a></h3>
                <h4>E-Commerce</h4>
                <p>Mengi Triggs, the owner of Rare Spirals, wanted to create a website for her growing jewelry business. Originally, she was selling her work through Etsy and Facebook. She was able to move her business away from Etsy by exclusively using the WooCommerce platform on her site (and thus, saving money by eliminating transaction fees).</p>

            <div class="gallery_product col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 filter hdpe">
                <a href="http://ujha.ericawalkerwebsites.com"><img src="assets/images/golden-palace.jpg" alt="mandala"></a>
                <h3><a href="http://ujha.ericawalkerwebsites.com">Uma Joy Healing Art</a></h3>
                <h4>Art and E-Commerce</h4>
                <p>This project is still in progress, but nearing completion. Uma Joy Mulnick is an artist who not only sells her work online, but regularly holds workshops and events teaching others how to create art. She wanted to rebrand her business (and existing site), so we created a retail platform with a new domain as well. Once complete, visitors will be able to purchase art and reserve space for upcoming events.</p>
